# gproxy-ghostgraz
From the original description 

    GProxy++ is a disconnect protection tool for Warcraft 3. It is modified by Phyton, Pr0gm4n and Manufactoring.
    
    Some features of the custombuild are: * New graphical user interface * GhostGraz game listing * Phrases * Autosearch * Ingame chat * Friendlist * Sounds * New commands and command shortcuts * Color * Mouse support * And much more...
    
Since the "ghostgraz-DOTA community?" is no more I removed most of the related functionality that was "in the way", so, It's basically the same minus that and with a better "auto search" feature, the "original" one missed many cases, and some fixes.
